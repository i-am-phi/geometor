- seek to understand the ordering principles of the universe
- demonstrate the merging of divine logic and natural order
- discern patterns in the systems

===

Since antiquity, there has been a fascination and reverence for a beautiful phenomenon known as the Divine Proportion, or more commonly, the Golden Ratio.

It is based on a simple relationship between two unequal values, A and B, where 

`A is to B as B is to the sum of A and B`

or

\[
\large
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{b}{a+b}
\]

But out of this most simple idea comes principles of proportion, harmonics and growth that are staggering in their logic,  expression and beauty.  

The Golden Ratio behaves as an inflection point between arithmetic and geometry with intriguing algebraic identities and geometric constructions that produce endless Golden Section instances out of the most fundamental formations. It appears to be everywhere. And it is not only evident in abstract concepts like mathematics, it is the principle of unfolding by which so many things, living and not, find their form.

**The Geometor Project** is dedicated to understanding the Architecture of All That Is. As we begin, we will shine light on the Golden Ratio, seeking to answer fundamental questions about the nature of its attributes. And perhaps, uncover the "root cause" - the conditions that bring it into existence. 

The Geometor Project has three primary objectives within its mission. 

* Gather Knowledge
* Uncover Patterns
* Share Wonder

### Gather Knowledge

* Establish a comprehensive **reference library** of attributes of the Golden Ratio, including: 
	* **clear definitions**
	* **algebraic identities** and proofs.
	* **arithmetic progressions**
	* **cross references** with external websites, resources, papers and books - especially Euclid. 
	* featuring **beautifully designed** content with MathML integration
* Create a **catalog of Golden Section** geometric constructions and proofs.
* Establish a well organized **hierarchy and taxonomy** - such as categories, tags, etc.
* Expand into **related fields** such as rational trigonometry, proportional systems, harmonics, and hyperbolic geometry
* Study **natural systems** - particularly phyllotaxis, the study of the growth pattern of plants

### Uncover Patterns

* Create a rigorous foundation of **geometric and algebraic frameworks** for the proofs and analysis.
* Integrate **tools and technologies** such as Geogebra, application libraries, algebra solvers and other graphics and math applications. 
* Conduct **research and analysis** to identify attributes and properties of the Golden Ratio 
* Uncover **underlying patterns** that could potentially explain the beautiful relationships it holds within.
* Design **styles and techniques** for highlighting concepts
* Develop **algorithms and automation** of processes
	* create an assembly language for constructive geometry

### Share Wonder
- Paint a picture. Give it a voice. It is **creative expression** that brings light to what we do, that connects the dots, that draws you in.
- All the artifacts we create are considered art. Expressions of pure logic for **meditation, decoration or ornamentation**.
- **Inspire others** with images of things they have never seen before
* Develop **modes of expression** in images, poetry, animation, video
* Share my **philosophical observations** in regular articles
* Create **art and moving images** that inspire and reveal the beauty of all ways that the Divine Proportion can be expressed.


## Philosophy
Geometor represents:

- the Architect of Geometry
- The Creator of Logic and Proportion
- The Architecture of All That Is

There is something mystical in the unfolding of the Golden Ratio. It always emerges within the intersection of unlike proportions - where the disruptions are not in discord but in harmony.

The pursuit of pure logic - unequivocal truth - is a sacred path. Also a path of discipline and determination. The Geometor Project is not a religion. But we do hold the intention to be in a deeper understanding and awareness of the awe-inspiring ordering principles at work in everything around us.  
x / y
The Geometor Project will:

- be eager to share knowledge
- be driven in the quest to know
- be welcoming of fruitful collaborations
- be humble in the beauty of what we discover
- be grateful for the opportunity to learn
