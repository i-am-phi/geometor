- Phi emerges at the outset when exploring the simplest of logical relationships

===


\[
\large
\mathbf{\Phi^2 \, - \, \Phi \, - \, 1= \, 0 }\\
\]


\[
\large
\mathbf{roots\; of\; \phi \, :=  \,  \left\{  \left(\frac{-\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}, 0 \right),  \left(\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}, 0 \right) \right\} }
\]

\[
\large
\mathbf{\color{#C90}{\phi} \, =  \, \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}  } \approx 1.618033989\\
\large
\mathbf{\color{#C90}{\varphi} \, =  \, \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} } \approx .618033989\\

## The Definition

It is known by many names.
The Divine Proportion
The Golden Ratio, Mean, Section

Euclid Extreme and Mean Ratio

A proportion is a relationship between two values. Such as  1:2 or a:b or a/b

**Two values are in The Divine Proportion when the ratio of the lesser value over the greater value is equal to the greater value over the sum of the lesser and greater value.**

In other words, when a segment is sectioned into the Divine Proportion, the parts are in a harmonic relationship to the whole.
Setting up a Harmonic Rhythm.

The very nature of the Golden Ratio is harmonic resonance
